# BookYourMovie: Movie Ticket Booking System

BookYourMovie is a full-stack web application that allows users to browse movies, view showtimes, and book seats. It features a modern, responsive user interface and a robust backend to manage movie data and user bookings. The application is built using the MERN stack and integrates with Auth0 for secure user authentication.

## Features

-   **Browse Movies**: View a list of currently playing movies with posters and genres.
-   **View Show Details**: Get more information about a movie, including its description and available showtimes.
-   **Seat Selection**: An interactive seat map allows users to select one or more available seats.
-   **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration are handled by Auth0. Users must be logged in to book tickets.
-   **Personalized Experience**: The navigation bar greets users by their first name and provides a dropdown menu for accessing their bookings and logging out.
-   **My Bookings**: Users can view a list of all their past and upcoming bookings.
-   **Cancel Bookings**: Users have the option to cancel their bookings.
-   **Dynamic Seat Availability**: The available seat count is calculated in real-time and displayed for each showtime.

## Tech Stack & Architecture

The application is built on the **MERN stack**, a popular and powerful combination of technologies for creating full-stack web applications.

-   **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing all application data, including movie shows and user bookings.
-   **Express.js**: A backend web application framework for Node.js, used to build the RESTful API that the frontend communicates with.
-   **React**: A JavaScript library for building the user interface, allowing for a dynamic and responsive single-page application (SPA).
-   **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment that executes the backend server code.

For user authentication, the application integrates with **Auth0**, a third-party service that handles user login, sign-up, and security.

### Frontend (Client-Side)

The frontend is what the user sees and interacts with in their browser. It was built using React and a rich ecosystem of libraries to create a modern, interactive experience.

-   **Core Library: React.js**
    -   **Functionality**: Manages the UI as a collection of components. Key features used include:
        -   **Components**: The UI is broken down into reusable components like `ShowList`, `ShowDetails`, `MyBookings`, and the navigation bar in `App.jsx`.
        -   **State & Hooks**: `useState` and `useEffect` are used extensively to manage component-level state, such as the list of selected seats or the currently chosen showtime.

-   **UI Framework: Material-UI (MUI)**
    -   **Functionality**: Provides a library of pre-built, customizable React components that follow Material Design principles. This was used for:
        -   **Layout**: `Grid`, `Box`, `Container`, and `Card` for structuring the pages and movie listings.
        -   **Navigation**: `AppBar`, `Toolbar`, `Button`, `Menu`, and `MenuItem` for the main navigation bar and user dropdown.
        -   **Feedback**: `CircularProgress` for loading states, `Alert` for messages, and `Snackbar` for notifications.

-   **Routing: React Router (`react-router-dom`)**
    -   **Functionality**: Enables navigation between different views or pages within the single-page application. It maps URLs like `/`, `/show/:showId`, and `/my-bookings` to their corresponding React components.

-   **Data Fetching & Server State: React Query (`@tanstack/react-query`)**
    -   **Functionality**: Simplifies fetching, caching, and updating data from the backend. It manages loading and error states automatically and helps keep the UI in sync with the server data. For example, it's used to fetch the list of shows and the details for a specific movie.

-   **Authentication: Auth0 React SDK (`@auth0/auth0-react`)**
    -   **Functionality**: Integrates the frontend with Auth0 for secure user authentication. It provides:
        -   Hooks like `useAuth0()` to get user information (e.g., name, email) and authentication status.
        -   Methods like `loginWithRedirect()` and `logout()` to manage the login and logout processes.

-   **Build Tool: Vite**
    -   **Functionality**: A modern frontend build tool that provides a fast development server with features like Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and bundles the code for production.

### Backend (Server-Side)

The backend is the engine of the application. It handles business logic, communicates with the database, and provides data to the frontend through an API.

-   **Runtime Environment: Node.js**
    -   **Functionality**: Allows JavaScript to be run on the server, enabling a consistent language across the entire stack.

-   **Framework: Express.js**
    -   **Functionality**: A minimal and flexible Node.js framework used to create the application's RESTful API. Key aspects include:
        -   **Routing**: Defines the API endpoints (e.g., `/api/shows`, `/api/bookings`) and directs incoming requests to the correct controller logic.
        -   **Middleware**: Functions that run between the request and the response. We use middleware for:
            -   `cors`: To allow the frontend (on a different origin) to make requests to the backend.
            -   `express.json()`: To parse incoming JSON payloads in request bodies.
            -   A custom middleware to extract a unique user identifier from the `X-User-ID` request header, ensuring users can only access their own data.

-   **Database Interaction: MongoDB & Mongoose**
    -   **Functionality**:
        -   **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It's well-suited for the evolving needs of this application.
        -   **Mongoose**: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library that provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model application data. It's used to define schemas for `Show` and `Booking` and to interact with the MongoDB database.

## API Endpoints

### Shows

-   `GET /api/shows`: Get a list of all shows.
-   `GET /api/shows/:id`: Get details for a specific show.

### Bookings

-   `GET /api/bookings`: Get all bookings for the authenticated user.
-   `POST /api/bookings`: Create a new booking.

## Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, you will need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd movie_ticket_booking_system
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

You will need to create two `.env` files: one for the frontend and one for the backend.

**Backend (`backend/.env`):**
```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

**Frontend (`frontend/.env.local`):**
```
VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN=your_auth0_domain
VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your_auth0_client_id
VITE_AUTH0_AUDIENCE=your_auth0_audience
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
```
*Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.*

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary packages for both the frontend and backend.

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 4. Run the Application

You will need to run the frontend and backend servers in separate terminals.

**Run the Backend Server:**
```bash
# From the /backend directory
npm start
# Or using node:
node app.js
```

**Run the Frontend Development Server:**
```bash
# From the /frontend directory
npm run dev
```

The application should now be running, with the frontend accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy) and the backend at `http://localhost:3000`.
